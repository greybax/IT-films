#### Scorpion
> Scorpion is a high-octane drama about eccentric genius Walter O'Brien and his team of brilliant misfits who are the last line of defense against complex, high-tech threats of the modern age. As Homeland Security's think tank, O'Brien's Team Scorpion includes Toby Curtis, an expert behaviorist who can read anyone; his new wife, Happy Quinn, a mechanical prodigy; and Sylvester Dodd, a statistics guru. Pooling their extensive technological knowledge to solve mind-boggling predicaments amazes federal agent Cabe Gallo. However, while this socially awkward group is comfortable with one another's humor and quirks, life outside their circle confounds them. They rely on Paige Dineen to translate the world for them, who has a young, gifted son, Ralph, and a budding relationship with Walter. At last, these quirky masterminds have found the perfect job: a place where they can apply their exceptional brainpower to solve the nation's crises while also helping one another learn how to fit in.

#### The Lone Gunmen
> Spin-off of The X-Files featuring the trio of computer-hacking conspiracy geeks popularly known as The Lone Gunmen. Never ones to stray far from the center of corporate and government intrigue, the threesome of John Byers, Melvin Frohike, and Richard Langly play like a misguided Mission Impossible team, embarking on a series of comic adventures that simultaneously highlight their genius and ineptitude. While their newfound independence inspires them to investigate even the most shadowy of conspiracies, their social skills remain stagnant, which only makes their lives more difficult when they learn their chief competitor in the "information business" is the brilliant and beautiful Yves Adele Harlow. Perpetually short of funds to publish The Lone Gunmen newspaper, Byers, Frohike and Langly begrudgingly take on Jimmy Bond as an unlikely benefactor who bankrolls their missions and joins them in their investigations to uncover the truth.
